PkPAdv
======

PkPAdv stands for "PokePlanet Advanced". The initial proposal was to have the same game provided by #PokePlanet around 2001
but supporting new pokemon featured in GBA versions (pokemon #252 to #386). So I had to start it from zero, but I already
had previous experience in IRC Scripting in the past with other games. After a couple of time, PkPAdv became more interesting
than the original bot of PokePlanet.

Besides the improved battle system (with lots of old and new pokemon moves supported), it started to have a small story line on top of it,
and then players could start their game in a city and then move around to find new challenges and quests to solve. Then I've added the first
gym leader. It required some IA to choose moves inside the battle. After a couple of time, the IA improved a lot and I confess, I couldn't beat it
anymore.

The system became rather complex, and contains three whole continents: Hoeen, Kanto and Johto. You could start from either Hoenn or Kanto, and then
at some point you would be able to travel to the other continent. Once you're done with those two continents, you could travel to Johto, the latest challenge.
The story line is very complex and I confess I'm very proud of it. The system became rather complex with time, and very fun to play... but unfortunately,
nobody cares about IRC games anymore (at least not the pokemon fans that speaks portuguese).

I've still tried to develop the new version using IRC Scripting as server and a python client with graphics, so players should be able to actually walk
around the map and interact with the game in a whole new way, similar to the original games. This task was more complex than I've thought, and I didn't
have enough knowledge of programming back there, so it was a failure and I couldn't keep it up, and also realized that IRC Scripting was not good for
multiple tasks at the same time, so I had to leave it anyway.

These are some screenshtos of what this game almost became:

What's next?
------------

I won't be able to make this useful anymore. This is why it now becomes free. Feel free to develop it, change it, copy it, do whatever you want. If you
really have plans to go ahead and make this a real game, I suggest you to get out of IRC Scripting and try C++ or Python, depending on what you want.

Special thanks

* c0rps3 - Pokemon specialist, it provided me **a lot** of help to develop the battle system.
* ic3 - Owner of #PokePlanet's bot back there. He taught me lots of IRC Scripting.
* Lit0 - Best player of PkPAdv. He managed to become pokemon master and caught almost all pokemon. Congratulations!

And to everyone else that was part of this project somehow! Thanks!
